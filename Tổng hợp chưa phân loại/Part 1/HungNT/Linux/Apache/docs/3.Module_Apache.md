**# Apache Module**  

Các module của Apache:

1) mod_security

2) mod_rewrite

3) mod_deflate

4) mod_jk

5) arp

6) arp-util

 

- **Mod_security:**  
Là một module thông dụng của Apache .Mod_security có khả năng tăng cường bảo mật , bảo vệ server khỏi các cuộc tấn công. Sử dụng các rule sets để chặn các cuộc tấn công . Mod_security hoạt động như một firewall.


mod_rewrite:

The mod_rewrite is also very popular in the web hosting industry. As the name indicates, it is used to rewrite the URLs and so that the redirection can be achieved. The module has a rewrite engine which will rewrite a requested URL based on a PCRE regular expression parser.

The mod_rewrite uses unlimited rules. Each rule can have unlimited attached rule conditions which enables the rewriting based on server and environment variables, HTTP headers, etc.

An example of a rule for redirecting a url that starts with ‘http’ to ‘https’ is given below.

RewriteEngine On

RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off

RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]

This is how the mod_rewrite works.

 

mod_deflate:  

The next Apache module we are going to see is the mod_deflate. This module is used to compress the output from the webserver before sending to the client. This is used to reduce the size of the output file, so that the client can download it faster.

The following directive will enable the compression for documents in the container where it is placed.

SetOutputFilter DEFLATE

If Apache is being used as a reverse proxy and you need to process the content which passes through the proxy, you can use the mod_deflate for decompressing purpose as well. However, it is rarely used and the common use of mod_deflate is to compress the web server output. The mod_deflate uses a combination of LZ77 algorithm and Huffman coding. This ensures no data is lost while compressing the files. If the output file size is less than 120 bytes (approximately), then the output file will be larger after being processed by the mod_deflate. This happens because this module does not have a lower bound for the file size. The mod_gzip is similar to mod_deflate.

 

mod_cache:  

The mod_cache is the Apache module that is used for content caching. Let us take a look at this module in detail.

The Web Caching

Web caching is a way to improve the performance of the server. Here, the commonly requested content will be stored in an easy to access locations so that the client can access the data faster and client does not need to retrieve the data every time when the request is demanded. We can create caching rules for making caching effective. However, highly dynamic content will be served to the client normally from the server.

There are many other methods also used by Apache for the purpose of web caching and one of them is using mod_file_cache module.

 

mod_proxy:  

The next module we are going to see is mod_proxy. This is an optional Apache module. This module implements a proxy, gateway for Apache server. It supports many commonly used protocols and many load balancing algorithms. To enable this feature, a set of modules will need to be loaded onto the server. This include the following.

1) mod_proxy

2) mod_proxy_balancer (If the load balancing is required, one or more balancer module also needed with this)

3) One or more proxy scheme, or protocol, module:



mod_jk
mod_jk is a replacement to the elderly mod_jserv. It is a completely new Tomcat-Apache plug-in that handles the communication between Tomcat and Apache.   

apr 
The mission of the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) project is to create and maintain software libraries that provide a predictable and consistent interface to underlying platform-specific implementations. The primary goal is to provide an API to which software developers may code and be assured of predictable if not identical behaviour regardless of the platform on which their software is built, relieving them of the need to code special-case conditions to work around or take advantage of platform-specific deficiencies or features.

apr-util  
 The Apache Portable Runtime Utility Library provides a predictable and consistent interface to underlying client library interfaces. This application programming interface assures predictable if not identical behaviour regardless of which libraries are available on a given platform.

This package is known to build and work properly using an LFS-8.4 platform.  

- Cài đặt mod_security:  
```
yum install mod_security mod_security_crs
```  
Edit ModSecurity configuration file /etc/httpd/conf.d/mod_security.conf and look for the SecRuleEngine Directive on the File and configured with the Desired Value.

        On – Rules are activated
        Off – Rules are Deactivated
        DetectionOnly – Only Intercepts and logs Transactions

Since we want to Intercept and Block Attacks we configure it with On.

 SecRuleEngine on  

Step 4 – Restart Apache and Check

After completing all the configuration, restart Apache service on your system.

service httpd restart

To confirm that our web application firewall is working we should see something like this in our Apache error logs.
