The Graylog server application has the following prerequisites:

Some modern Linux distribution (Debian Linux, Ubuntu Linux, or CentOS recommended)

    Elasticsearch 5 or 6

    MongoDB 3.6 or 4.0

    Oracle Java SE 8 (OpenJDK 8 also works; latest stable update is recommended)

**Caution**

    Graylog prior to 2.3 does not work with Elasticsearch 5.x!

**Caution**

    Graylog 3.x does not work with Elasticsearch 7.x!

**Hint**

    Graylog 3.x does include first compatibility with Java 11 and we welcome people that test this.

**Hint**

    Graylog 3.x does work with MongoDB 4.2 when this runs in compatibility mode 4.0
